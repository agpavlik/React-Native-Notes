### ðŸ“’ Two ways of styling <a name="2"></a>

Styling language is inspired by CSS and close to CSS, but it's not exactly the same.

```javascript
<View style={{ flexDirection: "row", height: 100, padding: 20 }}>
  <Text>Hello World!</Text>
</View>
```

Inline style (style prop) is not supported on all elements.

```javascript
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>Hello World!</Text>
</View>;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: "#ddd",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  },
});
```

Style sheet objects allows to clearly separate JSX code and it also makes styles reusable.

### ðŸ“’ Debugging <a name="3"></a>

React Native provides an in-app developer menu which offers several debugging options. One of the popular is React Developer Tools

```
sudo npm install -g react-devtools
react-devtools
```

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/text'>Text</a> - component for displaying text

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/textinput'>TextInput</a> - foundational component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/image'>Image</a> - component for displaying different types of images

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/stylesheet'>StyleSheet</a> - abstraction similar to CSS StyleSheets

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/pressable'>Pressable</a> - wrapper that can detect various stages of press interactions on any of its defined children.

- <a href='https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/status-bar/'>StatusBar</a> from 'expo-status-bar'. A library that provides the same interface as the React Native StatusBar API, but with slightly different defaults to work great in Expo environments.

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/imagebackground#example'>ImageBackground</a> - has the same props as <Image>, and add whatever children to it you would like to layer on top of it.

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/safeareaview'>SafeAreaView</a> - render content within the safe area boundaries of a device. It is currently only applicable to iOS devices.

- <a href='https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/'>LinearGradient from "expo-linear-gradient"</a> - provides a native React view that transitions between multiple colors in a linear direction.

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/usewindowdimensions'>useWindowDimensions</a> - automatically updates all of its values when screen size or font scale changes

- <a href='https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview'>KeyboardAvoidingView</a> - will automatically adjust its height, position, or bottom padding based on the keyboard height to remain visible while the virtual keyboard is displayed
